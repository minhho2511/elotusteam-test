# Frontend Test

- Total time: 72 hours (please no more!)

## NEO - Feed API

This is an API from NASA. When you give a to and from date, it will return you asteroids close to Earth. Use the NEO - Feed api endpoint.

API documentation https://api.nasa.gov/

![Asteroids - NeoWs](/images/asteroids.jpg "Asteroids - NeoWs")

This is a basic coding test to see if you can create a new project, call an API and display some data from the response. Use the endpoint to build whatever front end application you'd like - it's up to you to make it as simple or complex as you want!

What we're looking for is something that shows your creativity, deep understanding of front end design patterns, an eye for performance, and your ability to develop something you'd be proud to put into production.

### Frameworks

Our only requirement is that you use either [Angular](https://angular.io/) or [React](https://reactjs.org/).

Any CSS pre-processing libraries, testing frameworks, build frameworks, state management libraries, etc. is completely up to you!

### The Task

  1. Create a project from [Angular](https://angular.io/) or [React](https://reactjs.org/)

  2. Create a screen with two components:

    a. SearchForm component

      i. Two date pickers (to date and from date)

      ii. When user selects both dates it will do a search to the NASA API

      iii. When user changes date again it will do another search

    b. SearchResults component

      i. Display a list of the asteroid names from the NASA API

  3. Additional feature (optional)

    List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

**When you're done, send us back a link to a repository with your source code, with a description of what you've done and any build instructions in the readme!**
